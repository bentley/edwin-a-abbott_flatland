				To<br/>
				The Inhabitants of SPACE IN GENERAL<br/>
				And H. C. IN PARTICULAR<br/>
				This Work is Dedicated<br/>
				By a Humble Native of Flatland<br/>
				In the Hope that<br/>
				Even as he was Initiated into the Mysteries<br/>
				Of THREE Dimensions<br/>
				Having been previously conversant<br/>
				With ONLY TWO<br/>
				So the Citizens of that Celestial Region<br/>
				May aspire yet higher and higher<br/>
				To the Secrets of FOUR FIVE OR EVEN SIX Dimensions<br/>
				Thereby contributing<br/>
				To the Enlargement of THE IMAGINATION<br/>
				And the possible Development<br/>
				Of that most rare and excellent Gift of MODESTY<br/>
				Among the Superior Races<br/>
				Of SOLID HUMANITY
